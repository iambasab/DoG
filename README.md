# DoG_Convolution - "Information recovery from rank-order encoded images" (2008)
This repository contains the matlab files that I developed as a part of my Doctoral work at the University of Manchester, School of Computer Science. The thesis link is here.\n
http://apt.cs.manchester.ac.uk/people/bsen/my_thesis.pdf  \n
The files are not commented well, but if you would want to use any part of the code for your work, please drop me a mail and I am happy to walk you through the codes. (basab.sen.b@gmail.com)
